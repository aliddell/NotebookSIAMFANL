    "This small book on solvers for nonlinear equations\n",
    "is a user-oriented guide to algorithms and implementation.\n",
    "It is a sequel to \n",

    "which used MATLABÂ® for \n",
    "the solvers and examples. This book uses Julia and adds new material\n",
    "on pseudo-transient continuation, mixed-precision solvers, and\n",
    "Anderson acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its purpose is to show, via algorithms\n",
    "in pseudocode, in Julia, and with several examples, how one\n",
    "can choose an appropriate Newton-type method for a given problem and\n",
    "write an efficient solver or apply one written by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is intended to\n",
    "complement my larger book complement my larger book \n",
    "<cite data-cite=\"ctk:roots\"><a href=\"siamfa.html#ctk:roots\">(Kel95)</cite>,\n",
    "which focuses on in-depth\n",

    "solving particular problems, implementation in any particular language,\n",
    "or evaluating a solver for a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational examples in this book were\n",
    "done with Julia 1.4 on various Apple computers.\n",
    "The Julia codes for the solvers are in a Julia package.\n",
    "I provide a Jupyter notebook to enable the reader to run all\n",
    "the examples in the book and play with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found that Julia is an excellent environment for a project\n",
    "like this, which unifies a print book, a package of solvers, and an\n",
    "interactive notebook. I have used all the solvers in my own research\n",
    "and many of the examples come from that research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes are tuned for clarity and the algorithmic parameters are\n",
    "exposed so the reader can play with them. I have sacrificed a\n",
    "good deal of abstraction, some generality, and a bit of performance\n",
    "for that clarity.  The solvers\n",
    "were designed for production work on desktop and laptop comptuters\n",
    "to solve small-to medium-scale\n",
