    "If the Jacobian is sparse and you use the solvers from __SuiteSparse__ then you cannot use single precision. Even if the structure of the Jacobian allows you to use the LAPACK solvers or a special-purpose package, there is less benefit in using single precision for linear algebra than in the dense case. We will explore that for the boundary value problem, where we can use [BandedMatrices.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/BandedMatrices.jl) and __qr!__ for the linear solver. __qr!__ supports single precision linear algebra, so we will use that. __lu!__ does not, so the support is not consistent.\n",

    "Updating the Jacobian less frequently has a smaller impact than in the case of the H-equation. You should expect this because the linear solver costs $O(N)$ work rather than $O(N^3)$ and the Jacobian is updated for the early iterations because the residual is not decreasing fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other interesting feature of this computation is that the single precision results differ in a meaningful way from the double precision results. The reason for this is that the Jacobian is ill-conditioned enough to affect the quality of the single precision solver. The condition number of the Jacobian is $O(1/N)$, so for $N=10^5$ one should expect poor results from the linear solve in single precision, and that's what you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the benchmark results say that there is no benefit from doing the linear algebra in single precision. This is also no surprise since the factorization is $O(N)$ work.\n",
